/* We can see from this analysis that 1,577 are people shopping for families. This population also brings in roughly 40% of the store's revenue. The multi-adult home customer base consists of 795 customers,
but they bring in roughly 39% of the store's revenue. So, although the "FamilyHomes" population brings in the most revenue overall, the "MultiAdultHomes" population is bringing in the most revenue per customer. */
